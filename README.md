<h1>Python Duck Hunt</h1>

This was a project I did while still in highschool, the objective was to recreate a classic game using Python.

The game of my choice was [Duck Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) which was released in 1984/1985/1987 (Japan/US/Europe) for 
NES console.

<h3>Objective</h3>
For my game I added a little twist to it, the goal of the game is simple, shoot as many ducks as possible using the least amount of shots in the time provided to you.

<h3>Game Play and Controls</h3>
Controls for this game are extremely simple, simply use the mouse to move the cursor around on the screen.

P - Pause and unpause the game

Left Mouse Click - Shoot


The game gives you one minute to shoot as many ducks, at the end you will see your accuracy and the number of ducks that you successfully hit.
