<h1>Python Duck Hunt</h1>

This was a project I did while still in highschool, the objective was to recreate a classic game using Python.

The game of my choice was [Duck Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Hunt) which was released in 1984/1985/1987 (Japan/US/Europe) for 
NES console.

For my game I added a little twist to it, the goal of the game is simple, shoot as many ducks as possible in the time
provided to you.
